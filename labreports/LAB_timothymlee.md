# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 19 | LinkedIn had an easy to understand format with clear paths for users to follow to complete an action. The layout of the page could possibly be improved for screen readers and by removing unnecessary content such as ads for premium memberships and reviews. |
| Glassdoor | 14 | Glassdoor had a similar layout to LinkedIn but had a lot more clutter. It was harder to follow due to certain tabs not bringing up the expected page and having a lot of extra content not related to the search. |

## 2.2 Site 1: LinkedIn
### LinkedIn Home Screen

The home screen in pretty standard. The "Sign in" page is in the expected location and is made clear with a different color.

### LinkedIn Login Screen
![LinkedIn Login Screen](../assets/L2.png) 
The "Sign in" page is, again, pretty standard. Clear path shown on page.

### LinkedIn User Home Screen
![LinkedIn User Home Screen](../assets/L3.png) 
The social media feed is, again, standard and what is expected. The tabs across the top are clear. I don't like the "Messaging" tab popping up on its own and covering the screen.

### LinkedIn Job Page
![LinkedIn Job Page](../assets/L4.png) 
The jobs page is what I have learned is standard across many websites. I like that everything is seperated into blocks, but don't like the ads. I would have a search bar centered instead of at the top of the page for easier use of that.

### LinkedIn Job Search Results
![LinkedIn Job Search Results](../assets/L5.png) 
The formatting of the search results is nice. The filter options are clear but out of the way and only information relevant to the selected job is shown on the right, while options are shown on the left.
 
| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | Everything was clearly labeled and the labels took the user to the expected page. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | Navigation was clear and easy with a lot of suggestions to guide user quickly to desired pages. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3 | Information is formatted clearly with large buttons, often highlighted, to direct user on next steps. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | The website highlighted the current section of the website the user is looking at. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2 | There were lots of extra things on the page that distracted the user from the desired content like ads and requests for reviews. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | Work flow was very clear with highlighting of current section of website. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2 | Works fine on the phone but they layout seems like it could cause screen reader issues. |
| **TOTAL** | 19 |   |

## 2.3 Site 2: Glassdoor
### Glassdoor Home Screen
![Glassdoor Home Screen](../assets/G1.png)
The home screen in pretty standard. The Sign in page is in the expected location and is made clear with a different color. I don't like the really large "Sign-Up" part in the middle as a returning user.

### Glassdoor User Home Screen
![Glassdoor User Home Screen](../assets/G2.png)
The user home page is pretty boring but gets the job done. The tabs are clear but the content in the middle of the page isn't helpful.

### Glassdoor Job Page
![Glassdoor Job Page](../assets/G3.png)
The job page is not my favorite. It took me a while to figure out how to search for the job, as I was expecting options to immediately show up when I clicked on "Jobs."

### Glassdoor Search Results
![Glassdoor Search Results](../assets/G4.png)
I do not like this search engine-esk design that Glassdoor uses. It leads to a lot of information that I don't care about as I search for a job. The irrelevent information is something I would use Google to find instead of Glassdoor. Also, their search suggestions were not helpful.

### Glassdoor Job Search Results
![Glassdoor Job Search Results](../assets/G5.png)
The formatting of the search results is nice. The filter options are clear but out of the way and only information relevant to the selected job is shown on the right, while options are shown on the left. It looks almost identical to LinkedIn but has some nice large graphics like the "Average Base Salary Estimate."

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | Everything was clearly labeled but some labels took the user to an unexpected page. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 1 | The search result for the job search had a lot of irrelevant information that limited search results. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | Home page had a lot of suggestions after first use for relevant information. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | The website highlighted the current section of the website the user is looking at. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2 | Search suggestions were not really suggestions but categorie selections. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2 | As stated previous, some labels took the user to an unexpected page, but it was mostly clear. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2 | Works fine on the phone but they layout seems like it could cause screen reader issues. |
| **TOTAL** | 14 |   |
